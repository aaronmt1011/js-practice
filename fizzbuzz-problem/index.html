    <title>FizzBuzz Problem</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This project deals with FizzBuzz which is a children's game that teaches about division.</p>
    <p>A number (n) is picked from 1 - 100.</p>
    <p>This program prints out numbers from 1 to picked n (number).</p>
    <p>However for certain numbers, it will print fizz, buzz, or fizzbuzz instead.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For numbers that have multiples of three (ex. 3, 6, ...), it will print Fizz instead.</li>
        <li>For numbers that have multiples of five (ex. 5, 10, ...), it will print Buzz instead.</li>
        <li>For numbers that have multiples of both three and five (ex. 15, 30, ...),  will print FizzBuzz.</li>
    </ul>
